			<div class="paragraph">
				I worked as a journalist for six years in my life. It was my first job and I really enjoyed writing things that was interesting, and for me, pertinent for citizens in my town. When I started learning programming I don't really know where was this going to take me. Four years later I worked for three companies, in a dozen of projects for a lot of different clients. In a lot of ways I learned and grew not only as a professional, but also as a person. Now I have a lot of skills to build things and know what to learn to construct projects that I want.

				I think it's time to share some knowledge and apportion some ideas. If you have something to share with me, please enter in contact.
